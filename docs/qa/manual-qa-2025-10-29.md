# Manual QA – Cross‑Browser (2025‑10‑29)

This document tracks a focused manual pass across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari (desktop) and one mobile simulator. It also covers network throttling and a lightweight memory‑pressure check.

## How to Run Locally

- Build + preview:
  - `npm ci`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run preview` (serves on http://localhost:4173)
- Keyboard shortcuts: Cmd/Ctrl + J toggles the debug palette; Space steps when paused.

## Browsers & Devices

- Chrome 129 (macOS)
- Firefox 131 (macOS)
- Safari 18 (macOS)
- iOS Simulator Safari (iPhone 15 Pro)
- Optional: Android Emulator Chrome

## Checklist (repeat per browser)

- Initial DOM: Button visible; no console errors.
- Activate cloth: Click the button; DOM element fades; cloth mesh appears and pins according to Pin Mode default (Top).
- Real‑Time toggle: Turn off; verify `Step (Space)` appears; Space advances simulation by one step.
- Gravity: Adjust; observe faster settling; no console errors.
- Constraint Iterations: Increase; observe stiffer cloth.
- Substeps: Increase; observe smoother integration (esp. during manual stepping).
- Pointer Collider: Toggle; sphere follows pointer and renders while paused.
- Camera Zoom: Adjust; renderer zooms; “Camera Zoom (Actual)” updates.
- Warm Start: Set passes, click “Warm Start Now”; cloth relaxes constraints immediately.
- Re‑init: Close debug, refresh, repeat activation once; no duplicate render systems; no warnings.

## Throttling & Memory Checks (Chrome DevTools recommended)

- Network: Enable “Slow 3G”; reload; ensure UI remains responsive while html2canvas loads; activation still works.
- Memory: Open Performance or Memory tab; Activate → scroll → deactivate → refresh → repeat 3×. Expect no steady growth in JS heap; WebGL resources count stable (renderer/context persists, meshes dispose on recycle).

## Results Matrix

| Browser | Initial Render | Activate | Pause/Step | Gravity | Iterations | Substeps | Pointer Overlay | Zoom (Actual) | Warm Start | Re‑init | Throttle | Memory | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome 129 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Firefox 131 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Safari 18 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| iOS Safari (sim) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
