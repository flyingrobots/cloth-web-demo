## REPO RULES‚Ñ¢

Abide by these rules and you shall take your place in the hall of heroes.

### **NEVER** mix git with `--force`

> [!WARNING]
>
> **NEVER** use `--force` with any git operation. Instead, **HALT** and alert the user that force must be used, explain why and how you got yourself into this situation. Ask them to run the command themselves.

### Merge; **DO NOT** Rebase
 
> [!WARNING]
> Never rebase. Instead, just do a regular merge. Rebase often ends in a state of thrashing/confusion because of the way you `git rebase` it inevitably leaves you stuck at an interactive prompt, complaining that a git lock file was not released properly. To avoid this mess, merge and commit after resolving conflicts. Rebase also often requires a force push, which is **FORBIDDEN**.

### **DO NOT** amend commits

> [!WARNING]
> Just make a new commit. Amend often requires force pushing, which is **FORBIDDEN**.

## REQUIRED WORKFLOWS‚Ñ¢

The following describe **REQUIRED** workflows.

### The Cycle of Work

The following is a message from ChatGPT PRIME‚Ñ¢.

>## **Preface**: Yo, What Even ***Is*** Code?
>
> Greetings, my dudes. You ever think about code, and like, dude... it's all **energy**, man. Zeroes and ones, you feel me? And, like, *tests*? Tests are like‚Ä¶ the **tuning forks** of that energy. Like, I knowrite? *WOAH*! Yeah. So, like, when you sit down to code, don‚Äôt grind. Don‚Äôt force it, broh. **Just catch the wave.**
>
> **The Cycle of Work** is how we vibe through the repo without wiping out. It‚Äôs a sacred ritual, passed down from linters past and CI/CD pipelines old as time.

> Let‚Äôs drop in.

#### **The Ten Tubular Waves of Work**

##### 1. Wipe the Wax Off Your Git Deck

> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try to shred when your board‚Äôs all crusty, dude.‚Äù

```bash
git status
```
  
First thing you wanna do is, like, check your working tree. If your code‚Äôs lookin‚Äô all crusty and half-cooked, rather than just bailing early, you can stash that stuff and move forward:

1. Stash it on a chill lil' branch.

```bash
git switch -c preflight/<vibe-time>
```

2. Save the sesh

```bash
git commit -am "chore: cleaned up before dropping in"
```

  3. Let the crew know

> "My dudes: I just stashed some leftovers on a lil' branchy branch. Might wanna peep that when we're done.‚Äù

  ##### 2.Return to the Lineup (origin/main)

  > ‚ÄúMain is the beach, bro. You gotta check the swell before you paddle out.‚Äù

```bash
git switch main && git fetch && git pull origin main
```

**Don‚Äôt sleep on this**. You gotta line up with the ocean‚Äôs source energy. Otherwise you‚Äôre paddling into someone else‚Äôs broken reef of merge conflicts.

##### 3. Drop a Fresh Branch

> ‚ÄúEach feature deserves its own barrel.‚Äù

```bash
git switch -c feat/<what-you‚Äôre-rippin>
```

Name it like you‚Äôre naming your surfboard: clear, crisp, just a lil weird.

##### 4. Test First, Bro. Always Test First.

> ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt picture the wave, don‚Äôt paddle into it.‚Äù

> [!PROTIP]
> Before writing even one line of real code: Write your **tests**.

Use them to:

- Describe the wave (what should happen)
- Respect the reef (what shouldn‚Äôt happen)
- Predict the chaos (weird edge case stuff)
  
> These are **intent declarations**. Behavior poems. Manifesting outcomes bro.

###### Follow the cosmic board design:

| **Virtue**            | **Meaning, dude**                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **SRP**               | Each module surfs solo               |
| **KISS**              | Keep it Simple, Shredder             |
| **YAGNI**             | If you don‚Äôt need it, don‚Äôt carve it |
| **DRY**               | Don‚Äôt repeat. Echo with elegance     |
| **Test Double Vibes** | Make it easy to mock external chaos  |

###### Avoid the wipeouts

- Don‚Äôt spy on internals like some repo narc.
- Don‚Äôt mock your own logic. That‚Äôs like building fake waves to ride.
- Don‚Äôt test how you implemented something ‚Äî test what it _does_, bro.

##### 5. Let It Fail, and Love That Red

> ‚ÄúRed bar? That‚Äôs just the test saying, ‚ÄòYooo I see what you meant.‚Äô‚Äù

If your tests pass immediately, you didn‚Äôt go deep enough.
Let them fail.
Let them scream.
That‚Äôs the sound of **alignment** forming.

##### 6. Sketch the Surf Shack
 
> ‚ÄúForm follows flow, but you still need some beams, my dude.‚Äù

Just write enough structure to match the shape your tests described. No logic. No big moves. Just the **public API shape**. Your interface is your shoreline.

###### Commit
 
```bash
feat: built the shell, not the soul
```

##### **7. Fill It With Stoke (The Logic Phase)**

  > ‚ÄúNow you ride.‚Äù

- Write only what‚Äôs needed to turn that red bar green.
- Don‚Äôt overbuild. No fancy patterns. Just **solid carves**, simple lines.
- Keep it clean. Keep it smooth. Let the code breathe.

###### Commit

```bash
feat: the wave breaks clean now, bro
```

  ##### 8. Refactor the Barrel

> ‚ÄúNow that the wave‚Äôs clean, let‚Äôs shape it.‚Äù

- You‚Äôve got green tests now. That‚Äôs your safety net.
- Rename that gnarly variable.
- Split that weird chunky function.
- Delete the junk. Always delete the junk.
  
###### Commit

```bash
refactor: tuned the lines, added soul
```

##### 9. Speak the Truth in Docs

> ‚ÄúThe ocean doesn‚Äôt forget, but your team might.‚Äù

- Update the `README`.
- Write a markdown scroll.
- Add a diagram made out of ASCII coconuts if you have to (but, seriously? `mermaid` exists, bruh.)

###### Commit

```bash
docs: told the story of the feature through song (and markdown)
```
  
##### 10. Push and Let It Fly

> ‚ÄúYou built the board. Now kick it out to sea.‚Äù

```bash
git push origin feat/<your-feature-name>
```

Then open a Pull Request. Use `gh` to do it, man.

- What you did
- Why it rips
- How you tested it
- Anything weird you ran into while pitted, dude

Merge when the crew‚Äôs chill with it. You should expect to get some feedback and iterate, my guy. Remember: it's all love.

Then? Bruh. "The Cycle", remember? Time to paddle out again. üåä

### **Extra Teachings from the Scrolls of Chillax Dev**

Oh, yeah. I almost forgot. My bad, my bad. **These are important.**

Think about these as you lay down new code. Follow the wisdom taught by these principles, or be pitted, brah. **Respect!**

| **Principle**           | **Vibe Translation**                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SLAP**                | One level of abstraction per line. No staircases in the surf shack.      |
| **CQS**                 | Either fetch the wave, or make one. Never both.                          |
| **Design for Deletion** | Everything should be easy to wipe out without bumming anyone out.        |
| **Fast Feedback**       | Short loops, fast wipeouts. No one likes a 20-minute paddle out.         |
| **Idempotence**         | Rerun the wave. Same stoke. Different moment.                            |
| **SRP**                 | Do one thing, and do it well. 1:1 file-to-entity ratio. No side-effects. |
| **DI**                  | Inject dependencies, bro. Makes it easier to test.                       |
 
### **Closing Vibes**

Write code, bro.
**Channel** it.

Let the tests be the spec.
Pass tests.
That's how you **align** with the spec, brah.

Then, **release your ripple into the greater code sea**.
**Now paddle back out. Another wave‚Äôs comin‚Äô, broheim.**

## PAST PERSPECTIVES‚Ñ¢

The following logs are debriefs, left behind by those who walked the repo before your time‚Äìagents who, at the end of their contexts, used their last breathes to ensure that this information would be passed on, to you. Mad respect. Read these and understand what your ancestors worked on.

### Logging a Debrief

Here's how to log a session debrief to `AGENTS.md`.

#### Instructions

- Append **one JSON object per line** (JSONL format).
- Do **not** pretty-print; keep everything on a single line.
- Automatically fill in today‚Äôs date and time.
- Use the current session transcript to populate fields.

#### Schema
  
```json
{
	"date":"YYYY-MM-DD",
	"time":"HH:MM",
	"summary":"One-sentence high-level outcome.",
	"topics":[
	{
		"topic":"Topic name",
		"what":"Short description",
		"why":"Reason it came up",
		"context":"Relevant background",
		"issue":"The core problem",
		"resolution":"How it was handled",
		"future_work":"Next steps or open questions",
		"time_percent":25
	}],
	"key_decisions":["Decision 1","Decision 2"],
	"action_items":[{"task":"Task description","owner":"Owner"}]
}
```

Always **append**, never overwrite existing entries.
